Project Workflow:

Setup and Initialization:

Initialize the required libraries: OneWire, DallasTemperature, and LiquidCrystal_I2C.

Set up the hardware components: DS18B20 sensor, 16x2 LCD, red LED, green LED, and buzzer.

Define the pins for the sensor and LEDs.

Sensor Read and Display:

In the loop, continuously read the temperature from the DS18B20 sensor.

Calculate the temperature in Celsius and display it on the LCD.

Send the temperature value to the serial monitor.

Alert Mechanism:

If the temperature exceeds 38Â°C, activate the red LED and trigger the buzzer with a 1-second tone.

If the temperature is within the safe range, turn on the green LED and turn off the red LED and buzzer.

Timing Control:

The temperature is updated every 100 milliseconds (10 readings per second) to ensure real-time monitoring.

Use the millis() function to manage the timing and ensure the temperature is read at the correct interval.

Visual Feedback:

The LCD constantly displays the temperature value.

The green LED indicates normal conditions, while the red LED and buzzer indicate an alert.

Final Output:

The system will keep running, continuously updating the temperature display on the LCD and triggering alerts when necessary.
